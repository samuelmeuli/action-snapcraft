# Snapcraft Action

**GitHub Action for setting up Snapcraft**

## Overview

This action…

- Installs Snapcraft on macOS/Ubuntu
- Optionally logs you in to the Snap Store
- Allows you to run Snapcraft commands in your GitHub Actions workflows

## Usage

### Basic

To use this action, add the following step to your workflow:

```yml
- name: Install Snapcraft
  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v1.1.2
```

A full example:

```yml
name: My workflow

on: push

jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Snapcraft
        uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v1.1.2

      # You can now run Snapcraft shell commands
      - name: Use Snapcraft
        run: snapcraft --help
```

### Log in

This action can also log you in to the Snap Store. For this to work, you need an [Ubuntu One account](https://snapcraft.io/account).

You will also need a Snap Store login token. To obtain one, run the following command on your machine:

```sh
snapcraft export-login --snaps SNAP_NAME --channels edge -
```

Copy that token and add it as a secret to GitHub Actions. You can do this in your GitHub repository under Settings → Secrets. The secret must be called `snapcraft_token`.

Finally, add the following option to your workflow step:

```yml
- name: Install Snapcraft
  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v1.1.2
  with:
    snapcraft_token: ${{ secrets.snapcraft_token }}
    skip_install: true # optional, if already installed in an earlier step
```

### Build using LXD

LXD (`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`) is for now likely the easiest way to get `snapcraft` to build snaps. This is an alternative to using `multipass` (GitHub VMs give the error `launch failed: CPU does not support KVM extensions.` when trying to use `multipass`). It takes between 1 to ~10 minutes to set up `lxd` (varies wildly between runs).

```yml
- name: Install Snapcraft with LXD
  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v1.1.2
  with:
    use_lxd: true
- name: Build snap
  run: sg lxd -c 'snapcraft --use-lxd'
```
